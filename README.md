👋 Hello, I'm Alima Sharma, currently from the vibrant SF Bay Area. I'm joyfully navigating the journey of motherhood with my 6-month-old daughter, Yana, and caring for our two furry companions, PomPom and Polly.
👀 My curiosity fuels my passion for exploring new realms of knowledge and experiences.
🌱 Currently, I'm immersing myself in the world of coding and software engineering, eager to master its intricacies.
💞️ I'm open to collaborating on innovative projects that challenge and inspire growth in my role as a Software Engineer.

-⚡ Fun fact: I find joy in finding the perfect blend of professionalism and creativity in every endeavor. Also, I'm an avid salsa dancer and have even performed at a local salsa festival with a group of friends. Dancing not only keeps me active but also adds a dash of rhythm and spontaneity to my life!
